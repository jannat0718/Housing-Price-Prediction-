##**Using Linear Regression Model, built a prediction model to predict a house price on data collected from Kaggle**

*Using scatter plot, determined the linearly related features and built two separate models, and compare the model performances.


Linear regression:

Linear regression is a statistical method that models the relationship between a dependent variable (response) and one or more independent variables (predictors) by fitting a linear equation to the observed data. The goal of linear regression is to find the line that best represents the relationship between the input features and the target variable, minimizing the error between the actual and predicted values.

The linear regression model equation is of the form:

Y = β0 + β1 * X1 + β2 * X2 + ... + βn * Xn + ε

Where:

Y is the dependent variable (the variable we are trying to predict)
β0 is the y-intercept (the value of Y when all X variables are 0)
β1, β2, ..., βn are the coefficients of the independent variables X1, X2, ..., Xn, respectively, representing the influence of each variable on the predicted value of Y
ε is the error term, representing the difference between the actual and predicted values of Y

To make predictions with a linear regression model, you input values for the independent variables (X1, X2, ..., Xn) into the model equation. The model will then produce an estimate of the dependent variable (Y) based on the coefficients (β1, β2, ..., βn) it has learned during training.
